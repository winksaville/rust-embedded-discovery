# Flash it

Flashing is the process of moving our program into the microcontroller's (persistent) memory. Once
flashed, the microcontroller will execute the flashed program every time it is powered on.

In this case, our `led-roulette` program will be the *only* program in the microcontroller memory.
By this I mean that there's nothing else running on the microcontroller: no OS, no "daemon",
nothing. `led-roulette` has full control over the device.

Onto the actual flashing. First thing we need is to do is launch OpenOCD. We did that in the
previous section but this time we'll run the command inside a temporary directory (`/tmp` on \*nix;
`%TEMP%` on Windows).

Make sure the F3 is connected to your computer and run the following commands in a **new terminal**.

## For *nix & MacOS:
``` console
cd /tmp
openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

## For Windows **Note**: substitute `C:` for the actual OpenOCD path:
```
cd %TEMP%
openocd -s C:\share\scripts -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

> **NOTE** Older revisions of the board need to pass slightly different arguments to
> `openocd`. Review [this section] for the details.

[this section]: ../03-setup/verify.md#first-openocd-connection

The program will block; leave that terminal open.

Now it's a good time to explain what the `openocd` command is actually doing.

I mentioned that the STM32F3DISCOVERY (aka F3) actually has two microcontrollers. One of them is used as a
programmer/debugger. The part of the board that's used as a programmer is called ST-LINK (that's what
STMicroelectronics decided to call it). This ST-LINK is connected to the target microcontroller
using a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface (this interface is an ARM standard so you'll run into it
when dealing with other Cortex-M based microcontrollers). This SWD interface can be used to flash
and debug a microcontroller. The ST-LINK is connected to the "USB ST-LINK" port and will appear as
a USB device when you connect the F3 to your computer.

As for OpenOCD, it's software that provides some services like a *GDB server* on top of USB
devices that expose a debugging protocol like SWD or JTAG.

Onto the actual command: those `.cfg` files we are using instruct OpenOCD to look for a ST-LINK USB
device (`interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg`) and to expect a STM32F3XX microcontroller
(`target/stm32f3x.cfg`) to be connected to the ST-LINK.

The OpenOCD output looks like this:
``` console
$ openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg

```

The "6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints" part indicates the debugging features the processor has
available.

Leave that `openocd` process running, and in the previous terminal or a new terminal
**make sure that you are inside the project's `src/05-led-roulette/` directory**.

I mentioned that OpenOCD provides a GDB server so let's connect to that right now:

## Execute GDB

First, we need to determine what version of `gdb` you have that is capable of debugging ARM binaries.

This could be any one of the commands below, try each one:
``` console
arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
```
``` console
gdb-multiarch -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
```
``` console
gdb -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
```
### **Failing case**

You can detect a failing case if there is a `warning` or `error` after the `Remote debugging using :3333` line:
```
$ gdb -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...
Remote debugging using :3333
warning: Architecture rejected target-supplied description
Truncated register 16 in remote 'g' packet
(gdb)
```
### **Successful case**
Successful case 1:
```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...
Remote debugging using :3333
cortex_m_rt::Reset () at ~/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/cortex-m-rt-0.6.13/src/lib.rs:497
497     pub unsafe extern "C" fn Reset() -> ! {
(gdb)
```
Successful case 2:
```
~/embedded-discovery/src/05-led-roulette (master)
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -ex "target remote :3333" target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
(gdb)
```
In both failing and successful cases you should see new output in the **OpenOCD terminal**, something like the following:
``` diff
 Info : stm32f3x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints
+Info : accepting 'gdb' connection on tcp/3333
+Info : device id = 0x10036422
+Info : flash size = 256kbytes
```

**NOTE**: If you are getting an error like `undefined debug reason 7 - target needs reset`, you can try running `monitor reset halt` as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38994596/reason-7-target-needs-reset-unreliable-debugging-setup).

By default OpenOCD's GDB server listens on TCP port 3333 (localhost). This command is connecting to
that port.

## Update ../.cargo/config.toml

Now that you've successfully determined which debugger you need to use
we need to change `../cargo/config.toml` so that `cargo run` command will succeed.
Note: `cargo` is the rust package manager and you can read about it
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

Get back to the terminal prompt and look at `../cargo/config.toml`:
``` console
~/embedded-discovery/src/05-led-roulette
$ cat ../.cargo/config.toml
[target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf]
runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q"
# runner = "gdb-multiarch -q"
# runner = "gdb -q"
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
]

[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"

```
Use your favorite editor to edit `../.cargo/config.toml` so that the
`runner` line contains the correct name of that debugger:
``` console
nano ../.cargo/config.toml
```
For example, if your debugger was `gdb-multiarch` then after
editing the `git diff` should be:
``` diff
$ git diff ../.cargo/config.toml
diff --git a/src/.cargo/config.toml b/src/.cargo/config.toml
index ddff17f..8512cfe 100644
--- a/src/.cargo/config.toml
+++ b/src/.cargo/config.toml
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 [target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf]
-runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q"
-# runner = "gdb-multiarch -q"
+# runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q"
+runner = "gdb-multiarch -q"
 # runner = "gdb -q"
 rustflags = [
   "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
```

Now that you have `../.cargo/config.toml` setup let's test it using `cargo run` to
start the debug session.

> Note the `--target thumbv7em-none-eabihf` defines which architecture
> to build and run. In our `../.cargo/config.toml` file we have
> `target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"` so it is actually not necessary
> to specify `--target` we do it here just so you know that parameters on
> the command line can be used and they override those in `config.toml` files

```
cargo run --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```
Results in:
```
~/embedded-discovery/src/05-led-roulette
$ cargo run --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s

Reading symbols from ~/embedded-discovery/target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...
```

Now issue the `target remote :3333` to connect to the OpenOCD server
and connect to the F3:
```
(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
```

Bravo, we will be modifying `../.cargo/config.toml` in future. **But**, since
this file is shared with all of the chapters those changes should be made with
that in mind. If you want or we need to make changes that only pertain to
a particular chapter then create a `.cargo/config.toml` local to that chapter
directory.

## Flash the device

Assuming you have gdb running, if not start it as suggested in the previous section.

Now use the `load` command in `gdb` to actually flash the program into the device:
```
(gdb) load
Loading section .vector_table, size 0x194 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .text, size 0x20ec lma 0x8000194
Loading section .rodata, size 0x514 lma 0x8002280
Start address 0x08000194, load size 10132
Transfer rate: 17 KB/sec, 3377 bytes/write.
```

You'll also see new output in the OpenOCD terminal, something like:

``` diff
 Info : flash size = 256kbytes
+Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz
+Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz

```

Our program is loaded, let's debug it!
